      <h3>Hi, thanks for visiting. Here's a little bit about myself. I love desserts.</h3>
      <p>Breads, pastries, cakes, ice cream . . . but my favorite is chocolate, especially dark. However, I'm not a fan of chocolate flavored items, even chocolate flavored sweets such as chocolate ice cream. Here are some of my favorite chocolates!</p>

            <ul>
              <li>honestly, I like <i>all</i> of their bars, the flavors are distinct and the bars are thick which gives them a good crunch</li>
              <li>10% of their net profits go to saving wildlife!</li>
              <li>fair trade and vegan</li>
              <li>btw, my favorite fruits are blueberries</li>

              <li>the perfect snack</li>
              <li>it's a cookie and a bite of chocolate in the shape of a mushroom, cute</li>

            <p>
              One of my favorite apps, it not only tracks your run progress but donates to a charity of your choice. You can also get discounts to various running related products through the app.

      <h3>Hi, thanks for visiting. Here's a little bit about myself. I can't escape from spending money on escape rooms.</h3>
      <p>Working with friends to solve puzzles is just too fun. I prefer rooms with storylines and immersive decor. If you've never tried an escape room before you should definitely check it out. Escape rooms can be a wonderful team building excercise. Go on Yelp to find some good ones in your area.</p>
